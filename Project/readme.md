Hereâ€™s an example of a `README.md` file for your project. This assumes that you've built a file upload system like Google Drive, including all the mentioned technologies and pages.

# File Upload App

This is a simple file upload web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and additional technologies like Cloudinary for storing files. Users can register, log in, and upload files like JPG, PNG, JPEG, or GIF.

## Technologies Used

- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB ORM for interacting with the database
- **bcrypt**: Used for hashing passwords
- **jsonwebtoken**: Used for JWT-based authentication
- **cloudinary**: Cloud-based file storage and CDN
- **multer & multer-storage-cloudinary**: For handling file uploads to Cloudinary
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables
- **ejs**: Template engine for rendering views
- **express-validator**: For validating user input
- **cookie-parser**: For handling cookies in requests

## Features

- **User Registration**: Register a new account with a username and password.
- **User Login**: Login to your account using JWT-based authentication.
- **File Upload**: Upload images (JPG, PNG, JPEG, GIF) to Cloudinary, which will be stored securely.
- **Home Page**: After login, users can upload their files, view uploaded images, and manage their content.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- MongoDB instance (can use MongoDB Atlas for cloud database).
- Cloudinary account for file storage.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArnabSaga/Backend-Basic-MRNE/tree/main/Project
   cd file-upload-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Cloudinary and MongoDB credentials:
   ```
   CLOUDINARY_URL=your_cloudinary_url
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Routes

- **POST /register**: Register a new user
- **POST /login**: Login and receive a JWT token
- **GET /home**: Display the home page (requires login)
- **POST /upload**: Upload an image file to Cloudinary (requires login)

### Frontend

The frontend uses EJS as the templating engine. It provides pages for:

- Login: Form for users to enter their credentials.
- Register: Form to create a new account.
- Home: A page to upload files and view uploaded images.
