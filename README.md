# Backend and Full-Stack Basics with Express and Mongoose

This repository contains code and examples from a series of lectures designed to introduce backend and full-stack development concepts.

## Lecture Overview

### Lecture 2: Basics of Backend Development with Express
- **Topic**: Introduction to building a basic backend app.
- **Key Focus**: Using Express's `get` method to handle requests.

### Lecture 3: Basics of Full-Stack Development
- **Topic**: Connecting backend and frontend.
- **Key Focus**: Handling data from the backend server and displaying it in the frontend app.

### Lecture 4: Data Modeling with Mongoose
- **Topic**: Structuring data for backend applications.
- **Key Focus**: Creating and managing schemas using Mongoose.

### Lecture 5: Connecting HTML with Backend
- **Topic**: Integrating the backend with a static frontend.
- **Key Focus**: Serving HTML files and linking them to backend functionality.

### Lecture 6: Middleware and Custom Middleware
- **Topic**: Understanding middleware in Express.
- **Key Focus**: Creating and using custom middleware for backend logic.

### Lecture 7: Third-Party Middleware with Morgan
- **Topic**: Using third-party middleware in Express.
- **Key Focus**: Integrating Morgan for request logging and understanding its functionality.

### Lecture 8: Form Controller and Backend Form Handling
- **Topic**: Managing form submissions.
- **Key Focus**: Understanding the `form action`, `POST` method, and how the backend processes form data.

### Lecture 9: Connecting MongoDB Compass and CRUD Operations
- **Topic**: Integrating MongoDB Compass with the codebase.
- **Key Focus**:
   - Establishing a connection to MongoDB.
   - Implementing CRUD operations: **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** using Mongoose.

### Project: File Upload Web Application (MERN Stack)
- **Topic**: Integrating MongoDB Compass with the codebase.
- **Key Focus**:
   - Express: Web framework for handling HTTP requests.
